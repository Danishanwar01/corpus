                      Blockchain, on the other hand, serves as the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies.
                      It is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that records all transactions across
                      a network of computers. Each transaction is stored in a "block" and linked together in a
                      chronological order, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."
                      <br /><br />
                      This decentralized nature ensures transparency, security, and immutability of transaction records,
                      as each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one. Blockchain technology has
                      applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including supply chain management, voting systems,
                      healthcare records, and more. Its decentralized nature and security features make it a promising
                      solution for various industries seeking transparency and efficiency in their operations.
                      <br /><br />
                      In summary, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology represent innovative approaches to
                      finance and record-keeping, offering decentralized and secure solutions in an increasingly
                      digital world.
